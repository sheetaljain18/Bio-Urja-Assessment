According to me this problem provided all contraints is feasible upto a certain degree of error
processing the data has given the closes output of 12000.48 with only 8% error.

Getting exactly 12000 with 0% error in ratio of zonal wind farms may or may not be possible
as the processing of 100 factorial permutations can take a long time.
